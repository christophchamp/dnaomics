'''update-rc.d''' is a utility used to install and remove System-V style init script links.

==Example==
It is also important that nova-agent gets started in the boot process before the xe-linux-distribution utility is started. You can check that this is the case with the following command:

$ ls -l /etc/rc0.d/

If "nova-agent" is listed _before_ "xe-linux-distribution" in the list returned, then everything is okay. If it is not, then you will need to move it up in the boot initialization process.

Below is an example (note that the "20" might need to be change. You are trying to make that number lower than the number associated with "xe-linux-distribution". For an example, if xe-linux-distribution has "K86ex-linux-distribution", then we can use "20" for nova-agent because 20 < 86):

$ sudo update-rc.d -f nova-agent remove
$ sudo update-rc.d nova-agent defaults 20
