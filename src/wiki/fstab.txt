==barriers option for ext3==

barrier=<0|1(*)> This enables/disables the use of write barriers in
barrier (*) the jbd code. barrier=0 disables, barrier=1 enables.
nobarrier This also requires an IO stack which can support
barriers, and if jbd gets an error on a barrier
write, it will disable again with a warning.
Write barriers enforce proper on-disk ordering
of journal commits, making volatile disk write caches
safe to use, at some performance penalty. If
your disks are battery-backed in one way or another,
disabling barriers may safely improve performance.
The mount options "barrier" and "nobarrier" can
also be used to enable or disable barriers, for
consistency with other ext3 mount options.

Aside from that the customer would need to FSCK in order to correct any journaling issues.
