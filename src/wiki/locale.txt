sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales 
local
echo $LOCALE

You can list locales with

localedef --list-archive

or with

locale -a

Corresponding file size is given by

ls -lh /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive

To remove unsed locales you can do

sudo locale-gen --purge it_IT.UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8 && echo "Success!"

where it_IT.UTF-8 and en_US.UTF-8 are the only two locales I want. The && echo "Success!" at end is useful because locale-gen do not report errors if an unavailable or wrong locale is passed on command line.

==Set locate timezone==

 sudo apt-get install tzdata
 sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
