=== Download/Verify LiveCD ISO ===
Download the installation image of your choice from [http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/12.1/iso/ http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/12.1/iso/].
 ~> aria2c -x5 http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/12.1/iso/openSUSE-12.1-KDE-LiveCD-x86_64.iso
You may also want to verify the download integrity

 ~> gpg -a openSUSE-12.1-KDE-LiveCD-x86_64.iso.asc

=== Linux Instructions ===
==== Find Block Device ====
After inserting your USB stick, you can find out what device it is
 ~> su
 # grep -Ff <(hwinfo --disk --short) <(hwinfo --usb --short)
==== Write ISO to USB ====
Finally, once you've found your block device, write the image to it. Point 'dd' to the full path such as '/home/user/Downloads/openSUSE-12.1-KDE-LiveCD-x86_64.iso' or change directory (example: <code>cd ./Downloads</code>) to where the image is contained.
 # umount /dev/sdX
 # dd if{{=}}/path/to/downloaded.iso of{{=}}/dev/sdX

Alternate way to create live USB stick via command line on vfat partition [http://lizards.opensuse.org/2012/09/13/live-fat-stick/ live-fat-stick]

=== OS X instructions ===
==== Find Block Device ====
Plug-in your USB stick and find what "/dev/diskN" it is mapped to by opening Terminal (where "N" stands for "disk0", "disk1", "disk2" etc). To do so, please execute:
 # diskutil list
This will print out the list of currently mapped devices/partitions. Find the USB using "NAME" column. Then note the corresponding /dev/diskN, where "N" is for index of your disk. For example:

<pre>
/dev/disk2
   #:                       TYPE        NAME                    SIZE   IDENTIFIER
   0:                       FAT32                               2.0 GB   disk0
   1:                                   USB2                    2.0 GB   disk0s1
</pre>

In this case "/dev/disk2" is the one we want.

==== Unmount USB Stick ====
Unmount the USB stick
 # diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN
Where /dev/diskN is the one you have found in previous step as per our example it would be "/dev/disk2".

==== Write ISO to USB ====
Write the content of the ISO file:
 # dd if{{=}}/path/to/downloaded.iso of{{=}}/dev/diskN bs{{=}}4k
Again the /dev/diskN is the same one you have found previously. You will be prompted for the administrator's password.

==How to make a USB drive bootable==
# umount /dev/sdX
# fdisk /dev/sdX
: p   «--- print partition table
: a   «--- activate partition (bootable)
: 1   «--- apply to partition 1
: w   «--- write changes and exit
