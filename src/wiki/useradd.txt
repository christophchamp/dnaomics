usermod -aG wheel champ
useradd -m -s /bin/bash -c "Christoph Champ" -G wheel champ

==sudoers==
On Ubuntu, its really simple.

# adduser jak sudo

and you’re done!

On CentOS, theres a couple more steps.
As root, run

# /usr/sbin/usermod -aG wheel jak

then edit the /etc/sudoers file

# nano /etc/sudoers

go down and find this…

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

and remove the hash in front of %wheel so it looks like…

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

Once that’s done, your user “jak” is part of the wheel group, who are allowed to use sudo.
