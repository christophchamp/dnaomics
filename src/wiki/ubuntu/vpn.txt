VPN setup using the command line

Run the following:

sudo apt-get install pptp-linux

Create file /etc/ppp/peers/YOUR_COMPANY with this content:

pty "pptp YOUR_VPN_GATEWAY --nolaunchpppd"
debug
nodetach
logfd 2
noproxyarp
ipparam YOUR_COMPANY
remotename YOUR_COMPANY
name YOUR_DOMAIN_OR_SERVER_NAME\\YOUR_VPN_LOGIN
require-mppe-128
nobsdcomp
nodeflate
lock
noauth
refuse-eap
refuse-chap
refuse-mschap

Add to /etc/ppp/chap-secrets:

YOUR_DOMAIN_OR_SERVER_NAME\\YOUR_VPN_LOGIN * YOUR_VPN_PASSWORD *

Create file /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/add-subnet with content similar to:

[ "$PPP_IPPARAM" = "YOUR_COMPANY" ] || exit 0
route add -net 192.168.100.0/24 dev $PPP_IFACE

In the above line, adjust subnet values (192.168.100.0/24) if needed

Then run:

sudo chmod a+x /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/add-subnet

- Connect to VPN: sudo pon YOUR_COMPANY To disconnect, press Ctrl+C or close the terminal.

- If you do not want to see VPN connection debug output, in file /etc/ppp/peers/YOUR_COMPANY delete 3 lines: debug nodetach logfd 2

In this case, "pon YOUR_COMPANY" will run as a background process. Use "poff YOUR_COMPANY" to disconnect.

==Example==
Configuration

Create a configuration file (I called mine my_vpn.conf):

$ gksudo gedit /etc/vpnc/my_vpn.conf

I put in the following:

IPSec gateway X.X.X.X
IPSec ID GROUPNAME
IPSec secret GROUPPASSWORD
Xauth username USERNAME
Xauth password PASSWORD

Obviously, the capitalized values need to be replaced:

    IPSec gateway: the VPN's gateway/address
    IPSec ID: the group's name
    IPSec secret: the group's password
    Xauth username: the username
    Xauth password: the password associated with the username

Using your VPN

Once the file is saved, just start the vpn connection:

$ sudo vpnc my_vpn  # note: no need to include the .conf part
VPNC started in background (pid: 2691)...

Testing:

$ ping 172.30.0.144

To disconnect it:
