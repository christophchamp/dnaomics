==Manually Install Multiple Fonts==
# Download TrueType fonts. (The file extension will be .ttf.) Unzip your files if necessary.
# Copy .ttf files to
 /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype #~OR~
 /usr/share/fonts/truetype
# Make your own directory and copy the .ttf files into it
 sudo mkdir myfonts && cd myfonts
# Make sure they are borth user- and group-owned by root
 sudo chown root:root *.ttf
 sudo mkfontdir
 cd ..
 fc-cache # let Ubuntu known the fonts are installed so they do not disappear

# You have to create a directory texmf under your home directory, and extract the .zip file there, so that, for example, the file pgfplots.sty is in ~/texmf/tex/latex/pgfplots/pgfplots.sty.

 kpsewhich pgfplots.sty
# You can also add the line

Then bid farewell to whoopsie with

#Q: How do I remove old and/or no longer used Linux kernels
#A: Use apt-get
 The following package was automatically installed and is no longer required:
  linux-headers-3.5.0-22
Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove it.

===How to find manually installed packages===
With this suggestion, I'm assuming your old installation will still boot!

To replicate one set of packages on another machine:

On System A, run:
 dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall > my-selections

Move the my-selections file over to System B.

On System B, run:
 dpkg --set-selections < my-selections

and then:

 sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade

Important note: if you have installed packages from non-standard repositories and/or PPAs, you will also want to copy /etc/apt/sources.list and the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ from System A to System B before you run the upgrade.

You can use dpkg to see what you've removed as well (NB: this will also include packages that you manually installed and removed):

 dpkg --get-selections | grep deinstall

You can see your results in the terminal, or, of course, redirect to a file
