==Creating subdomains in localhost on Ubuntu==
SOURCE: http://thinkingnectar.com/2008/getting-ubuntu-to-work-creating-subdomain-in-localhost/

Creating subdomain(s) in any web development environment is essential. For
example, I have 2 projects going on at the same time and developement is
concurrent. And subdomains were not created. So we have this scenario:

 http://localhost/alphaproject/
 http://localhost/betaproject/
 http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

As you can see, I am assuming a Apache/PHP/MySql developemnt stack. 3 localhost
urls that will be frequently accessed. Imagine what will happen when you want
to access beta project? You "control+t" a new browser tab, and type in 
"localhost" only to have the url bar showing its history of the above 3 urls.
Then you press the down arrow key to access the required url.

Waste of keystroke I will say. Now we create subdomains and we have:

 http://alphaproject.localhost/
 http://betaproject.localhost/
 http://phpmyadmin.localhost/

So now when we want to access beta project? Type in "beta" and simply selected
the required "remembered" url. Save some keystrokes and it will save up a
sizable amount of effort over time.

So how to create subdomain in Ubuntu?

Edit /etc/host and add the following line

 127.0.0.1 alphaproject.localhost

Create a new configuration file at
 /etc/apache2/sites-available/alphaproject

In this configuration file, have the following:

    <VirtualHost *>
        DocumentRoot /home/username/alphaproject/
        ServerName alphaproject.localhost

        <Directory /home/username/alphaproject/>
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews +Includes
            AllowOverride None
            Order allow,deny
            allow from all
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

Save the file, and run the following:

 sudo a2ensite alphaproject

Finally restart the Apache Server (assuming you are using Apache2)

 sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

And by going to http://alphaproject.localhost/ you should be able to access
your newly created subdomain.

PS: phpmyadmin does come installed as a package but default to http://localhost/pma which I do strongly encourage users to change it to http://pma.localhost/

Think of the key strokes you be saving. And yes, do name your subdomain smartly, try picking each subdomain to have a different starting character.
