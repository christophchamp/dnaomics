Here is how to add more loop devices:

On Debian and ubuntu loop is a module, and you can specify the number of loop devices you want in /etc/modules. Replace:
 loop
by
 loop max_loop=64

(64 for example)

Then you have to disable the module:
 rmmod loop

and re-enable it:
 modprobe loop

But the new devices will not append automatically for sure, so if you do not see them in /dev/loop*, you can make them appear this way:
Edit /sbin/MAKEDEV and change :
        loop)
                for part in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                do
                        makedev loop$part b 7 $part $disk
                done
                ;;

By:
        loop)
                for part in `seq 0 63`
                do
                        makedev loop$part b 7 $part $disk
                done
                ;;

And execute
 $ MAKEDEV loop

For me this step did not work either, so I had to create it really by hand :
 for i in $(seq 0 63); do
     mknod -m0660 /dev/loop$i b 7 $i
     chown root.disk /dev/loop$i
 done
