==Remove history==


If you want to permanently remove the recent file list from totem, edit /usr/share/totem/totem.ui as root and change to following line:

<separator name="recent-separator"/>
<placeholder name="recent-placeholder"/>

into

<!--<separator name="recent-separator"/>
<placeholder name="recent-placeholder"/>-->

If you want to reactive history later, all you have to do is remove the part that you added.
