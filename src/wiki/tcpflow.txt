 tcpflow -i any -C -e port 1234  # as root, or with sudo

This does everything I want

    displays the data byte-for-byte as it comes in
    doesn't display any other metadata
    listens on all interfaces (so it captures data coming from within the machine and outside)

The "-C" tells it to dump to the console instead of a file. The "-e" enables colors so client->server and server->client are visually distinct.
