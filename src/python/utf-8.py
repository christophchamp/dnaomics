Try

## -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-

or

## -*- coding: latin-1 -*-

or

## -*- coding: cp1252 -*-

depending on what you really need. The last two are similar except:

    The Windows-1252 codepage coincides with ISO-8859-1 for all codes except the range 128 to 159 (hex 80 to 9F), where the little-used C1 controls are replaced with additional characters. Windows-28591 is the actual ISO-8859-1 codepage.

where ISO-8859-1 is the official name for latin-1.
