Style and Quality Guidelines
============================
- Any pull requests must be compliant with both pep8 and pep257 utilities with no overrides.
- Any pull requests must maintain a 10/10 rating with pylint --rcfile=pylint.rc (pylint.rc is in the base of the repo).
-- There can be exceptions to this one if you have a good reason. State your case within the PR.
- If something is already located in pyrax, use it from there, do not import anything that is not necessary.
